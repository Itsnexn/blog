# About
My name is Sina Jafar Beglu. Now, I am looking for my first full-time job. I have been working as a freelance web developer for the last years and cooperated with several startups. I cannot say with 100% confidence where I see myself in five years or what my big career goal is. The world is changing rapidly, and I don’t have enough professional experience to be certain about such things. However, I know that I can provide a fresh take and an extraordinary approach to every project.

## COLLABORATION
I work with commercial projects of any scale and with private requests. I use the latest tools and creative approaches that help solve a specific business or personal issue.

I’ll be happy to join creative teams to work on young-eyed commercial or social projects. If you think we can create something great together, contact me in any convenient way to discuss the possible cooperation.
